<h1>An Exploration of the Arxiv</h1>

<h2> What exactly is the Arxiv?</h2>
<p>Arxiv is a site dedicated to providing free access to research papers to the public, and offering a platform for researchers to publish their 
    work to a large audience. As part of that goal, they open source all data on the site, including all articles and their metadata. 
    This is the dataset that supports all the works below. You can view the data section for more detail </p>

<h2 id ='landscape'>1. What does the research landscape look like on Arxiv?</h2>
<p>The site focuses solely on STEM realted fields, these fields can be broken down to the following major categories</p>
<b>Feel free to click on any of the specific sections below to jump striaght there</b>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#mathematics">Mathematics</a></li>
    <li><a href="#computer-science">Computer Science</a></li>
    <li><a href="#physics">Physics</a></li>
    <li><a href="#electrical-engineering">Electrical Engineering</a></li>
    <li><a href="#economics">Economics</a></li>
    <li><a href="#quantitative-biology">Quantitative Biology</a></li>
    <li><a href="#quantitative-finance">Quantitative Finance</a></li>
    <li><a href="#statistics">Statistics</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at these prevalence of the these fields across all avialble years of data. We'll do this by totaling tag counts 
    and their assinged categories</p>

    <iframe src="overview.html" height="420" width="920" style="display: block; margin: auto;  border: none;">
    </iframe>

<p>As we can see physics, computer science, and mathematics make up >80% of the tags on the site. With the rest of subjects trailing far 
    behind.
</p>
<h2 id ='changes'>2. How has that landscape changes?</h2>

<p>Let's roll the clock back to 2007 and look at the category distribution back then </p>

<iframe src="overview_2007.html" height="420" width="920" style="display: block; margin: auto;  border: none;">
</iframe>

<p>As we can see physics was far and away the most published research subject; mathematics trailing in not a close second. Economics, Electrical Engineering, and Quantitative Finance were not supported topics yet.
    What you may find the most interesting though is computer science struggling to get 6%. Let's jump to now to 2023 and see how it's changed</p>

<iframe src="overview_2023.html" height="420" width="920" style="display: block; margin: auto;  border: none;">
</iframe>

<p>Now in 2023 we can find a much more well rounded landscape, with computer science actually over taking physics for the 
    top subject. Statstics has increased considerbly as well, and physics took an almost 50% hit in it's share.
</p>

<h2 id="ai">3. Can we use AI to better understand and explore the underlying structure of the research?</h2>
<p>Using all-mpnet-base-v2 we can project the texts of the abstracts (a randomized subset of 250k) into a dense embeddings space. Then with T-SNE we can further project 
these embeddings into 2 dimensions. </p>

<iframe src="dim_red.html" height="420" width="920" style="display: block; margin: auto;  border: none;">
</iframe>

<p>Potentially with a better backend model and dimensionality reduction algorithms we may be able to get more from this visualization 
    but as of now the results are lackluster. </p>

<h2 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h2>
<p>All though not as dominate as physics or computer science; mathematics is a facisnating field and a personal favorite of the author. 
    Let's start by looking at timeseries of it's prevelance throughout the years, then let's look at it's top 15 sub-categories by 
article counts (across all years). You may notice a large decrease from 2007-2009, keep an eye on physics and quantitative finance in those years. </p> 
<em>*Acticles can be cross listed with multiple categories, so these percentages may be inflated, or different from the pie charts.</em>

    <em>*Publication counts across all years</em>

<h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h2>
<p>It's little bit of a different story when it comes to computer science through the years; it has *fairly consistantly 
    increased its share of the tags on Arxiv. Boosted in no small part with rise of AI, as we can see from its top 15 sub-categories across the years.
</p>
<em>*Acticles can be cross listed with multiple categories, so these percentages may be inflated, or different from the pie charts.</em>

<em>*Publication counts across all years</em>


<h2 id="physics">Physics</h2>
<p>On the other side of coin we have physics, whose share of the tags has been decreasing steadily since 2015. Its top 15
    sub-categories are also shown below. Material science takes the number one spot in articles published </p>

<em>*Physics sub-categories naming convention differs from others, limiting the ability to shorten names easily </em>
<em>*Publication counts across all years</em>


<h2 id="electrical-engineering">Electrical Engineering</h2>
<p>Since its introduction in 2017, Electrical Engineering has rose steadily to an 8% share of articles containg EE tags.
     Its sub-categories are limited but more uniformly distributed when compared to other major subjects  </p>
<em>*Acticles can be cross listed with multiple categories, so these percentages may be inflated, or different from the pie charts.</em>
<p></p>
<em>*Please note the scale of both graphs below</em>

</iframe>
<em>*Publication counts across all years</em>

<h2 id="economics">Economics</h2>
<p>Similar to EE above, Econ was also introducted in 2017. It as well has rose it's share of article's tagged consistantly.
    But in contrast only to a measly 1.2%.  
</p>

<em>*Publication counts across all years</em>
<h2 id="quantitative-biology">Quantitative Biology</h2>
<p>With more volatility then we've seen so far is Quantitative Biology. It has bounced around 1-2% for its life time on the site.
    Surprisingly its top sub-category is populations and evolution. 
</p>
<em>*Acticles can be cross listed with multiple categories, so these percentages may be inflated, or different from the pie charts.</em>

<em>*Publication counts across all years</em>

<h2 id="quantitative-finance">Quantitative Finance</h2>
<p> Quantitative Finance has maintained its roughly 1% share of article tags since its introduction in 2008. You may notice its top sub-category
    though is economics. This may raise questions about its whether or not it's necessary as a major subject on the site.

<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<p>Statistics rose steadily throughout 2015-2020 and has been on a decline since. Its prevelance in the tags can certainly be attributed in 
    part to the rise ML/AI. All you have to do is take a look at its sub-categories
